# Tic Tac Toe
This is a 3x3 tic tac toe game made of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# How to play
By default I let X go first. But if you want to change to another letter, press the Reset button to change the playing position first.

The turn play is displayed below the board and next to the Reset button.

The Reset button can be pressed whenever you want to reset the game.

The party that ticks 3 boxes forming a diagonal, straight line (vertical, horizontal), that side wins and displays a notification that that side won. Click OK to start a new game.

In the next game, the losing side will go first.

If all the boxes in the chessboard are ticked and no one has won, the message will be displayed as a Draw, click OK to play a new game.
